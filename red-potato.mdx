### Ingredients 🛒
- 1.5 lbs red potatoes, washed and diced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- Salt & pepper to taste
- 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped (optional)

### Instructions 🥄

#### 1. Prep the Potatoes
Cut the red potatoes into bite-sized pieces, keeping them **uniform** so they cook evenly. No need to peel – the skin adds extra crispiness and flavor!

#### 2. Heat the Pan
In a large skillet, heat the **olive oil and butter** over medium heat until melted. The butter adds richness, while the oil keeps the potatoes from burning.

#### 3. Sear the Potatoes
Add the potatoes to the pan in a **single layer** (don’t overcrowd!). Let them cook undisturbed for about **5 minutes** until golden brown on one side.

#### 4. Season and Stir
Sprinkle the **garlic powder, smoked paprika, dried thyme, salt, and pepper** over the potatoes. Stir to coat evenly and continue cooking for another **10-12 minutes**, stirring occasionally.

#### 5. Crisp to Perfection
Reduce heat to **medium-low** and cover the pan. Cook for another **5 minutes** to ensure the insides are tender while the outsides stay crispy.

#### 6. Garnish & Serve
Remove from heat, sprinkle with **fresh parsley**, and serve hot. These potatoes pair perfectly with eggs, grilled meats, or just as a snack on their own!
