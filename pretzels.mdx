### 🥨 The Perfect Soft Pretzel
Soft pretzels are a staple in German bakeries and have taken the world by storm. The key to getting that **classic chewy texture** and **deep golden color** is boiling the pretzels in a **baking soda bath** before baking. 

### 🧀 The Sweet Beer Cheese Dip
Most beer cheese dips lean savory, but adding a touch of honey or maple syrup takes it to another level. A blend of sharp cheddar, a splash of beer, and a hint of sweetness makes this **the perfect pairing** for your homemade pretzels.

## 📝 Ingredients
### For the Pretzels:
- 4 cups all-purpose flour

- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 ½ tsp salt
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 10 cups water (for boiling)

## 🏆 Instructions
### Making the Pretzels:
1. **Activate the yeast:** In a bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.

5. **Boil in baking soda bath:** In a large pot, bring 10 cups of water to a boil. Add baking soda, then dip each pretzel for 30 seconds. Remove and place on a lined baking sheet.
6. **Brush and bake:** Brush with egg wash, sprinkle with sea salt, and bake at 425°F (218°C) for 12-15 minutes until deep golden brown.
