#### 4. Make Totoro’s Ears and Belly
Pour two **small pancakes** for Totoro’s ears and one smaller, round pancake for his belly. Cook as before and set aside.

#### 5. Assemble Totoro 🐾
Place the **large pancake** as the base, then attach the **two ear pancakes** at the top. Add the smaller pancake to the lower half of the body for Totoro’s belly.

#### 6. Add Facial Features
- Use **banana slices** for the eyes and place **chocolate chips** on top for pupils.
