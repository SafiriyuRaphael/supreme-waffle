We’ve all been there – waking up with a pounding headache, regretting last night’s choices, and desperately craving the kind of greasy, cheesy goodness that can bring us back to life.

### Ingredients You’ll Need:
- 1/2 lb ground beef 🥩
- 2 slices of thick bread 🍞
- 1 large egg 🥚
- 2 slices of cheddar cheese 🧀
- 1 tbsp butter 🧈
- 2 slices of crispy bacon 🥓
- 1 tbsp mayonnaise
- 1 tsp hot sauce 🌶️ (optional, but highly recommended)
- Salt & pepper to taste
- 1 tsp garlic powder 🧄 (for extra flavor)
- 1 tbsp caramelized onions 🧅 (because why not?)

### How to Make It:
1. **Form the Burger Patty** – Season the beef with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then shape it into a patty slightly larger than your bread slices. Cook it in a hot skillet for about 3-4 minutes per side or until perfectly juicy.
2. **Fry the Bacon** – Because everything’s better with bacon. Cook until crispy and set aside.
3. **Caramelize the Onions** – Slowly cook sliced onions in butter until they become golden and sweet. This step takes patience but adds a deep, rich flavor to your burger.
4. **Make the Egg in a Hole** – Use a round cutter (or a small glass) to cut a hole in the middle of one bread slice. Melt butter in the skillet, place the bread in, and crack the egg into the hole. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the egg sets, then carefully flip and cook for another minute.
5. **Assemble the Beast** – Spread mayo and hot sauce on the second slice of bread. Add a layer of cheese, the burger patty, caramelized onions, crispy bacon, another slice of cheese, then top it with your egg-in-a-hole bread.
6. **Grill it Up** – Melt more butter in the skillet and cook the whole sandwich like a grilled cheese – golden brown on both sides, with melted cheese oozing everywhere. 

### Why This is the Best Hangover Cure Ever:
- **Greasy & Cheesy Goodness** – Because your body is screaming for fat and carbs.
- **Protein-Packed** – That burger + egg combo will fuel your recovery.
- **Spicy Kick** – The hot sauce wakes up your taste buds and gets the blood flowing.
- **Bacon. Enough Said.**
- **Caramelized Onions Elevate It** – Adds a rich, slightly sweet depth to balance the grease.

### Bonus Tip:
If you want to **go even harder**, swap the bread for **buttered brioche** or **Texas toast** for extra indulgence. Or, throw in some **avocado slices** for a slightly healthy twist (but let's be real, you’re here for the grease).

So next time you wake up regretting life choices, whip up **The Ultimate Hangover Burger** and get yourself back in the game. Your stomach will thank you. 🍔🔥
