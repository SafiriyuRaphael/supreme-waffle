## Step-by-Step Instructions 👨‍🍳

### 1. Activate the Yeast
Dissolve the **yeast** and **sugar** in warm water. Let it sit for **5-10 minutes** until foamy.

### 2. Make the Dough
In a large bowl, mix **flour, salt, melted butter**, and the yeast mixture. Knead the dough for about **8 minutes** until smooth and elastic. Cover and let it rise for **1 hour** in a warm place.

### 3. Shape the Pretzels
Once risen, punch down the dough and divide it into **8 equal pieces**. Roll each piece into a **24-inch rope**, then twist into a pretzel shape. (Or get creative—knots, sticks, or bites work too!)
